# Optical-Character-Reader :mag:
Optical character recognition or optical character reader 	üîç is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten, or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document üìÑ,
a photo of a document, or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.<br><br>
<b>How it Works:</b><br><br>
<b>‚Ä¢</b>The first step of OCR is using a scanner to process the physical form of a document:page_facing_up:.<br>
<b>‚Ä¢</b>Once the page is copied, OCR converts the document into a two-color, or black-and-white version<br>
<b>‚Ä¢</b>The scanned image is analyzed for light and dark areas, dark area is identified as characters that need to be recognized, and light areas are identified as background<br>
Pattern recognition and feature detection are done by OCR.<br><br>
<b>Requirements:</b> PyTesseract <br><br>
<b>QuickStart:</b>  The application can be run by simply executing opticalCharacterRecognition.py.
